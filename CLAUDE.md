# ExamPrep AI — project memory

Read this before doing anything in this repo.

**Public brand is PrepPlan** (owner decision 2026-09-30). Everything a user sees says
"PrepPlan": web UI, page titles, PWA manifest, emails, the Android app and the Play listing. The
domain is `www.prepplan.in` (the bare `prepplan.in` redirects there), the Android package is
`in.prepplan.app` (permanent), and support mail goes to `support@prepplan.in`. "ExamPrep AI"
survives only as the internal project name: this repo, the database, the spreadsheet, code
comments and `examprep-*` identifiers. Don't put it back into anything user-facing. Android app =
F131, a Trusted Web Activity; see `android/README.md`.

## What this product is

A web app that generates syllabus-exact question papers for one school student, evaluates her
attempt question by question, and diagnoses whether each lost mark was a **knowledge gap** or a
**delivery habit**. The parent is the primary user; the student is secondary. **Update 2026-10-02 (user decision):** new sign-ups are students only -- no new parent accounts, and a student shares her own chapter mastery (text via the share sheet / WhatsApp, no stored link) with a parent. Existing parent accounts keep working unchanged and nothing is deleted. The student sign-up tick ("my parent or guardian agrees") is the consent record. Parent confirmation of marks is *no longer required* (done 2026-10-02): every paper a student submits is now marked at once -- multiple-choice from the answer key and confirmed, written answers by the AI then reviewed/accepted by the student exactly as on adaptive papers. A paper whose written answer the AI cannot mark with confidence still waits for a check (the old parent path, which existing parents keep). The hard rule below, "AI never finalises a mark on a normal paper", is therefore superseded for student-submitted papers. No F-number covers this yet.

The one-line test for any feature: *does it help answer "which marks did she lose because she
didn't know it, and which because she stopped writing too early?"* If not, it is out of scope.

**Launch scope:** CBSE Class 7 Mathematics, NCERT *Ganita Prakash* (Part I ch 1–8, Part II ch 1–7).
**Added 2026-09-20 at the user's request:** CBSE Class 9 Mathematics, NCERT *Ganita Manjari* Part I ch 1–8 (subject code `MATH9`, sources `iemh101`–`iemh108`, 6 concepts per chapter, 20 questions per concept, authored files in `content/authoring/class9/`). Part II of Class 9 is not loaded. **Also added 2026-09-20:** CBSE Class 9 Social Science, NCERT *Understanding Society: India and Beyond* Part 1 ch 1–9 (subject code `SST9`, sources `iest101`–`iest109`, concept codes `C9S-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class9s/`). No F-number covers this yet. **Also added 2026-09-20/21:** CBSE Class 7 Science, NCERT *Curiosity: Textbook of Science* Grade 7 (subject code `SCI`, sources `gecu101`–`gecu112`, concept codes `C7SC-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class7sc/`, variable concepts/chapter, 1420 questions total) — and CBSE Class 7 Social Science, NCERT *Exploring Society: India and Beyond* Parts 1–2 (subject code `SST`, sources `gees101`–`gees112` Part I and `gees201`–`gees208` Part II, concept codes `C7S-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class7s/`, `p1chNN.json`/`p2chNN.json`, 2740 questions total). Both fully loaded to production; this paragraph was missing until 2026-09-25, when the gap was found during a scope check.
**Added 2026-09-23 at the user's request:** CBSE Class 8 Mathematics, NCERT *Ganita Prakash* Grade 8 (subject code `MATH8`, sources `hegp101`–`hegp107` for Part I and `hegp201`–`hegp207` for Part II, concept codes `C8M-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class8/`, `chNN.json` for Part I and `p2chNN.json` for Part II). **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-24**: both parts, 14 chapters, 1680 questions. `hegp1ps.pdf`/`hegp2ps.pdf` are each part's front matter/prelims, not a problem-set appendix — correct that assumption if it resurfaces. **Added 2026-09-25:** CBSE Class 8 Science, NCERT *Curiosity: Textbook of Science* Grade 8 (subject code `SCI8`, sources `hecu101`–`hecu113`, concept codes `C8SC-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class8sc/`). No Part I/II split — a single 13-chapter book, confirmed complete against the book's own Contents page. **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-25**: all 13 chapters, 1560 questions. No F-number covers this yet. **Also added 2026-09-25 at the user's request:** CBSE Class 9 Science, NCERT *Exploration: Textbook of Science* Grade 9 (subject code `SCI9`, sources `iesc101`–`iesc113`, concept codes `C9SC-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class9sc/`). No Part I/II split — a single 13-chapter book, confirmed complete against the book's own Contents page. Note this book's title is *Exploration*, distinct from the Class 7/8 *Curiosity* books — don't assume the name carries across grades. **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-25**: all 13 chapters, 1720 questions. No F-number covers this yet. **Added 2026-09-26 at the user's request:** CBSE Class 6 Mathematics, NCERT *Ganita Prakash* Grade 6 (subject code `MATH6`, sources `fegp101`–`fegp110`, concept codes `C6M-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class6/`). Single 10-chapter book, no Part I/II split. **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-26**: all 10 chapters, 1280 questions. **Also added 2026-09-26:** CBSE Class 6 Science, NCERT *Curiosity: Textbook of Science* Grade 6 (subject code `SCI6`, sources `fecu101`–`fecu112`, concept codes `C6SC-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class6sc/`). Single 12-chapter book, no Part I/II split — confirmed via the book's own closing note. **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-26**: all 12 chapters, 1440 questions. **Also added 2026-09-26:** CBSE Class 6 Social Science, NCERT *Exploring Society: India and Beyond* Grade 6 (subject code `SST6`, sources `fees101`–`fees114`, concept codes `C6S-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class6s/`, flat `chNN.json` naming). Single 14-chapter book across five Themes A–E, no Part I/II split — confirmed against the front matter's own Contents page (`fees1ps.pdf` p.19: 14 numbered chapters, then Glossary at p.209). Note chapters 10–12 are each subtitled "Grassroots Democracy — Part 1/2/3"; that is the *chapter's* own mini-series subtitle, not a book-level part, and `part` stays `"I"` for all 14. **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-26**: all 14 chapters, 85 concepts, 1700 questions (ch 4 carries 7 concepts, the rest 6 each). **Also added 2026-09-26 at the user's request:** CBSE Class 8 Social Science, NCERT *Exploring Society: India and Beyond* Grade 8 (subject code `SST8`, sources `hees101`–`hees107` Part I and `hees201`–`hees207` + `hees209` Part II, concept codes `C8S-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class8s/`, `p1chNN.json`/`p2chNN.json` naming). Two-part book, 15 chapters total (Part I 7, Part II 8). Note `hees208` does not exist — Part II's chapter 8 file is genuinely named `hees209`, an NCERT file-naming quirk confirmed against the book's own Contents page, not a missing chapter. Part I and Part II each restart chapter numbering from 1 and deliberately reuse the same concept codes per chapter number (e.g. `C8S-1.m` exists in both parts, as distinct concept rows scoped by `chapter_id` per migration `0064_concept_code_unique_per_chapter.ts`) — this is the same pattern Class 7 Social already established, not a defect. **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-26**: all 15 chapters, 127 concepts, 2540 questions. No F-number covers any of this. The owner also supplied NCERT books for Class 10 under `New folder/`. **Fully loaded as of 2026-09-27:** CBSE Class 10 Mathematics, the standard older NCERT *Mathematics* series (Reprint 2026-27) — explicitly NOT *Ganita Prakash* (subject code `MATH10`, sources `jemh101`–`jemh114`, concept codes `C10M-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class10/`, single-part book, `part` always `"I"`). All 14 chapters, 89 concepts, 1780 questions, 100% reversal + assertion_reason/multi_statement coverage on every concept (verified directly against production, not just claimed). This edition is rationalized relative to the pre-2023 syllabus — several chapters lack sections a memory-based author would expect, confirmed per-chapter against the source rather than assumed: ch06 has no Pythagoras Theorem proof and no Areas of Similar Triangles; ch07 has no Area-of-a-Triangle-from-coordinates section; ch08 has no Complementary Angles section (its one "complementary" mention is a historical footnote on the word "cosine"); ch11 has no Areas of Combination of Plane Figures; ch12 has no frustum-of-a-cone or solid-conversion/recasting section; ch13 promises ogives/graphical median twice but never teaches them (vestigial references only, no Exercise 13.4); ch14 marks geometric probability explicitly "Not from the examination point of view" in the book's own text. **Known inconsistency, left as-is for now (user decision 2026-09-27):** `multi_statement` questions should use a 2-statement (I, II) format bank-wide, but ch07/ch10/ch11/ch12 and part of ch01 (~4-5 files) were authored with a 3-statement (I, II, III) format by mistake (traced to an unverified assumption introduced via a ch01 remediation delta) — caught before it could spread further (ch13/ch14 are correct). Lower severity than the assertion-reason-key issue above (no answer is guessable, no diagnostic category is missing, just a structural density difference); see memory for detail if ever revisited.

**Fully loaded as of 2026-09-27:** CBSE Class 10 Social Science (Geography), NCERT *Contemporary India II* (subject code `SST10`, name "Social Science (Geography)", sources `jess101`–`jess107`, concept codes `C10S-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class10s/`, single-part book, `part` always `"I"`). Geography only — the other three books that normally make up Class 10 Social Science (History, Political Science, Economics) were not supplied and are not in `New folder/`. All 7 chapters, 48 concepts, 960 questions, 100% reversal + assertion_reason/multi_statement coverage on every concept (verified directly against production). Uses the Social-Science AR/MS convention (1 assertion_reason-OR-multi_statement per concept, alternating type, one `Analyse|Hard` slot only) — correctly, from the start, unlike Class 10 Maths' ch01. **Another known inconsistency found and left as-is (user decision 2026-09-27):** `content/authoring/class8s/*.json` (Class 8 Social Science, all 15 chapters) was independently discovered to use the denser Maths-book AR/MS pattern (both slots every concept) instead of this correct alternating pattern — a pre-existing bank inconsistency found while authoring SST10, not introduced by it; every SST10 chapter correctly used `class6s`/`class7s` as precedent instead. No F-number covers any of this.
**Fully loaded as of 2026-10-02 at the user's request:** CBSE Class 12 Mathematics, NCERT *Mathematics* Part I and Part II (Textbook for Class XII, Reprint 2026-27; subject code `MATH12`, sources `lemh101`–`lemh106` for Part I and `lemh201`–`lemh207` for Part II, concept codes `C12M-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class12/ch01.json`–`ch13.json`). Unlike *Ganita Prakash*, Part II of this book **continues** Part I's numbering: its chapters are 7–13 with `part` `"II"`, so there is no chapter-number clash between the parts. All 13 chapters, 88 concepts, 1760 questions. **Also fully loaded 2026-10-02:** CBSE Class 11 Mathematics, NCERT *Mathematics* (Textbook for Class XI, Reprint 2026-27; subject code `MATH11`, sources `kemh101`–`kemh114`, concept codes `C11M-n.m`, authored files in `content/authoring/class11/`, single-part book, `part` always `"I"`). All 14 chapters, 90 concepts, 1800 questions. Both follow the Maths house style (exactly 1 assertion_reason + 1 two-statement multi_statement per concept, at least 1 reversal per concept), verified directly against production: every concept holds exactly 20 approved questions. Every question was also recomputed by an independent reviewer agent before loading (0 wrong keys found). Appendices and supplementary material (`kemh1a1`, `kemh1a2`, `kemh1sm`, `lemh1a1`, `lemh1a2`) are not loaded. Both editions are rationalised, confirmed per chapter against the source rather than assumed — a memory-based author would expect these and they are NOT taught. Class 12: binary operations; properties of inverse trigonometric functions; elementary row operations; properties of determinants; Rolle's and mean value theorems; tangents and normals; approximations; integral as the limit of a sum; area between two curves; formation of differential equations; scalar and vector triple products; planes (ch11 has lines only); the diet/manufacturing/transportation types of linear programming problem; random variables, mean and variance, Bernoulli trials and the binomial distribution (ch13 still promises them in its introduction). Class 11: power set and the n(A union B) formula; trigonometric equations and the sine and cosine formulae; polar form and quadratic equations (ch04 keeps both in its titles only); graphical solution of inequalities in two variables; general and middle terms of a binomial expansion; arithmetic progressions, special series and the infinite G.P. sum; normal form, shifting of origin and family of lines; section formula in three dimensions; chain rule and exponential/logarithmic limits; coefficient of variation; the random-experiments section of ch14. No F-number covers any of this.
Other classes and subjects follow later — see `docs/` tab 17.

## The plan lives in a spreadsheet

`docs/ExamPrep_AI_Module_Development_Plan.xlsx` is the source of truth for scope. 17 tabs:

| Tab | Use it for |
|---|---|
| 02 Module Master | The 22 modules, effort, % complete |
| 03 Feature Backlog | **130 features (F001–F130)** with user story + acceptance criteria. Work is picked from here. |
| 04 Data Model | 26 tables — build before UI |
| 05 API Endpoints | 38 routes with auth level |
| 06 Screens & Routes | 24 screens |
| 07 AI Layer | 12 AI functions: model tier, output contract, guardrails, fallback |
| 12 QA & Test Plan | 22 test scenarios (T01–T22) |
| 16 / 17 | Question bank depth and rollout sequence |

Never invent a feature ID. If work doesn't map to an existing F-number, say so and ask.

## Architecture invariants — violating these is expensive to undo

1. **Chapter identity is `(book, part, chapter_number)` — never the number alone.**
   Ganita Prakash Class 7 has two Chapter 3s and two Chapter 6s. Part I ch 3 is
   "A Peek Beyond the Point"; Part II ch 4 is "Another Peek Beyond the Point". A schema keyed on a
   bare number corrupts the moment Part II loads.

2. **`board` and `class` are first-class columns everywhere** — concepts, questions, blueprints.
   Adding Class 8 must be a data load, not a migration. Never hardcode "Class 7" in a route,
   a prompt, a PDF header or a seed file.

3. **Question depth is configuration, not a constant.** `target_question_count` lives per concept
   with subject/class defaults. Generation is a *top-up* job (target minus current approved count
   per Bloom×difficulty cell), idempotent and safe to re-run. Launch target is 20/concept.

4. **Nothing is deleted.** A question is either Approved (usable immediately on creation — there is
   no draft/review gate, removed 2026-09-17 at the user's explicit request) or Retired (pulled from
   the pool, never hard-deleted). Evaluations and the concept ledger are append-only so history
   stays auditable years later.

5. **Every question traces to an in-scope concept.** A question cannot exist without a concept, and
   a concept cannot exist without a chapter scope record citing the textbook and page range.

## Hard rules

- **AI never finalises a mark on a normal paper.** It proposes marks with per-step justification;
  a human confirms. The concept tracker only ever consumes confirmed values. (Tab 07 AI-05, tab 03
  F047.) **Exception, user decision 2026-09-20:** on *adaptive practice papers* no parent is needed.
  Multiple-choice marks come from the answer key and are confirmed on submit. Written answers are
  marked (generously) by the AI and shown to the *student*, who may question up to 5 marks (the AI
  re-reads once per answer and may only keep or raise a mark), remove a question she still disputes
  (it is flagged, never deleted, and left out of her grade and mastery), and then accepts; accepting
  is what confirms the marks. If the AI cannot grade a written answer confidently, the paper waits
  for a parent as before. Confirmations are written to the audit log (`evaluation.auto_confirmed`,
  `evaluation.student_finalized`).
- **The student role can never see or download an answer key** before or during an attempt,
  override a mark, or read another student's data. Enforced server-side, not by hiding a button.
  (T09.) **Exception, user decision 2026-09-22:** once her own attempt is submitted and its marks
  are confirmed, she may see the correct answer next to her own for every question -- reviewing
  what she got wrong (and why) is itself how she learns from it. If the same question is served to
  her again later and she simply remembers the answer, that is fine too; the purpose is learning,
  not testing recall of one specific item. This does not extend to a downloadable/printable key, to
  marks not yet confirmed, or to another student's data -- all still forbidden.
- **Never build a chat tutor that solves the problem.** Withholding the answer is the product
  *during* an attempt; the T09 exception above is about *after* it's over, and is not a contradiction.
- **Paper themes use original artwork only.** "Manga" is a genre and is fine to evoke; named
  franchises, their characters, logos and typefaces are not. The doodle theme is called
  **Doodle Journal** — never reference *Diary of a Wimpy Kid* in code, comments, assets or prompts.
- **Difficulty is not student-selectable on a normal paper (2026-10-05, user decision).** The
  paper's mix comes from its blueprint (target for a school-style paper: about 50% recall and
  understanding, 30% application, 20% analysis and evaluation); the generation screen has no
  difficulty control and `POST /api/papers/generate` and `generatePaper()` ignore any
  `difficulty_ceiling` on a non-adaptive paper. The 40% weak/priority concept weighting still
  applies and shortfalls are still printed (F119, F032). Unchanged: the question bank and its
  difficulty tags, existing papers, and adaptive practice papers (`/my-paper` keeps its own
  difficulty control, honoured only when `adaptive` is true).
- **"School Half-Yearly" is a blueprint, not code (2026-10-05, no F-number yet).** 80 marks, 3
  hours, layout in `blueprints.sections` + `blueprints.config` (written by
  `scripts/seed-school-half-yearly.ts` from `src/lib/school-paper.ts`). Social Science: History 25 /
  Geography 25 / Civics 20 / Economics 10, mix about 50/30/20, chapters tagged by
  `chapters.discipline` (`content/disciplines/`). Maths/Science: A 20x1, B 5x2, C 6x3, D 4x5, E 3x4
  case studies, mix about 25/45/30, **a draft estimate pending the owner**. Questions are told
  apart by `questions.tags` (`case_study`, `map`, `construction`, `figure`); a slot never takes a
  question it did not ask for, and a discipline slot is never filled from another discipline. OR
  needs the same marks and level from a different concept. `paper_questions.expected_words` is the
  word limit snapshotted at generation; an answer under half of it sets
  `evaluation_items.possible_stopped_early` (a diagnosis flag, never a deduction). Section
  totals, numbering and four options are checked before a paper is saved; the PDF prints and
  verifies its own page count.
- **Shortfalls are reported, never hidden.** If the bank can't fill a blueprint slot, generate the
  paper anyway with a printed note naming the concept and cell that came up short. (F032.)
- **A student may generate as many papers a day as she wants.** F112's original acceptance
  criteria said "within a daily quota"; this app enforced a default of 3 ("You've reached today's
  limit of 3 papers -- try again tomorrow"). **Removed 2026-09-24 at the user's explicit request**
  ("dont put any limits"). The independent INR spend ceiling (F121, `enforceStudentSpendBudget`)
  is unaffected and still applies -- this is only the raw daily paper-count check.

## Stack

TanStack Start (React 19) · TypeScript strict · Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui · Postgres (Neon or
Supabase) · Kysely · better-auth · Vercel. Server-side HTML→PDF for papers. See tab 09 for
rationale and rejected alternatives; do not swap a layer without updating that tab.

## Databases — tests never share one with real users

Three separate databases, and this separation is load-bearing:

| Which | Where | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Production | Supabase `examprep-ai-dev` (name is historical) | the deployed app, real students |
| Local dev | whatever `.env` points at | `npm run dev` |
| **Test** | **local Postgres only**, via `.env.test` | `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`, CI |

`vitest.setup.ts` loads `.env.test` and **refuses to start** if `DATABASE_URL` resolves to a
non-local host. There is no override flag. The suite creates and deletes fixture rows, and until
2026-09-23 it ran against the same Supabase project that serves real users — a crashed run left an
"Adaptive fixture subject" row active and a real student saw it in her own subject list, twice.
CI is unaffected: it already runs against an ephemeral `postgres:17` service on localhost.

First-time setup: install Postgres 17 locally, `createdb examprep_test`, copy `.env.test.example`
to `.env.test`, then `npm run db:setup:test` (migrate + seed).

## Conventions

- Concept codes: `C7M-3.2` = Class 7, Maths, chapter 3, concept 2. Namespaced by class + subject.
- Question IDs: `Q7M-3.2-001`.
- Source file codes are the real NCERT codes (`gegp101`…`gegp207`). Store them on the chapter row.
- Commits reference the feature: `feat(F033): server-side A4 PDF renderer`.
- Every PR that completes a feature updates column J in tab 03 to `Done`.

## Definition of done for a feature

1. Acceptance criteria in tab 03 are met literally.
2. The matching test in tab 12 passes, if one exists.
3. No cross-household data access is possible (T02 sweep still green).
4. Tab 03 column J updated.
