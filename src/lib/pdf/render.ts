 * F033: server-side HTML->PDF on headless Chromium (tab09's locked choice). A single browser

 * launching Chromium is the expensive part of a render (far more than opening a page), and this
 * runs inside a request handler today (no background job queue exists yet, tab09's own "do not
 * run OCR/PDF inside a request handler" warning is a known gap, not an oversight -- see the F033
 * backlog note), so a request-scoped process would relaunch it every time regardless; keeping one
 * instance warm at least avoids paying that cost per PDF within a single warm process (and,
 * concretely, per test run in this suite -- launch/teardown churn across repeated PDF tests was
 * observed contributing to Vitest worker crashes on this memory-constrained host).
