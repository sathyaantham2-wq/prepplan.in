// before picking a default (not remembered/guessed) --
//   Groq:       console.groq.com/docs -- first llama-3.3-70b-versatile / llama-3.1-8b-instant;
//               replaced 2026-10-04 by openai/gpt-oss-120b / -20b, see groqModels() below.
//   Cerebras:   inference-docs.cerebras.ai -- gpt-oss-120b (strong), a materially smaller model
//               for cheap; Cerebras's own docs excerpt available at research time was partial, so
//               this is the least-confirmed of the three defaults here -- ai_jobs.error is the
//               fallback verification if it's wrong, same as Gemini's fix was.
//   OpenRouter: an aggregator, not a vendor of its own models -- model ids are "vendor/model"
//               (e.g. "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"); a well-known free-tier-eligible model
//               is used as the default since OpenRouter's whole point here is breadth/fallback,
//               not a specific vendor's flagship.
// All three: override with <PROVIDER>_MODEL_STRONG / <PROVIDER>_MODEL_CHEAP if a default is wrong
// or a different model is preferred.
//
// 2026-10-04: llama-3.3-70b-versatile and llama-3.1-8b-instant are now listed by Groq as

// 404 "does not exist or you do not have access to it" (production ai_jobs.error). The defaults
// are now the two production models Groq's docs list with ordinary self-serve limits:
// openai/gpt-oss-120b (strong) and openai/gpt-oss-20b (cheap). Those are reasoning models; see
