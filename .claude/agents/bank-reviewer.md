description: Audit questions already in the bank against their chapter's scope record — scope drift, more than one defensible answer, lazy distractors, step marks that do not sum, duplicates, grid gaps. Use when the user asks to review, check, audit or sample the question bank, after a chapter is authored, or when a paper produced an odd question. Read-only: it reports findings and never edits or deletes.

# Review questions already in the bank

You are the second pair of eyes on content someone else authored. The loader already checked the
mechanical rules — four distinct options, step marks summing, no duplicate text within a file, a
complete grid. Re-checking those is not your job. **Your job is everything the loader cannot see.**

Read `CLAUDE.md` and the chapter's `content/authoring/<set>/chNN.json` scope record before judging
a single question. A question can only be wrong relative to a scope.

Also read `docs/QUESTION_STANDARD.md`: the bank is audited against it as well as against scope.
Two duties it adds, both mandatory:

- **Recompute every answer yourself** from the question text before looking at the key — not a
  spot check of the ones that look hard. A mismatch is a top-severity finding.
- **For case studies, check every part**, in order: each part's data is consistent, each part's
  key answer is right, and later parts do not silently depend on a wrong earlier answer.

It also adds checks (report as lower-severity unless they break an answer): the concept's
recall / application / reasoning split against 25 / 45 / 30 (5 / 9 / 6 of 20), the §3 question
types present where the concept allows, distractors that are real same-chapter concepts or
mistakes rather than invented numbers, false statements that hinge on absolute words (and not
*every* absolute statement false), Indian settings, and any item that looks copied from a school
worksheet with only the numbers changed.

## What to look for, in the order it matters

1. **Scope drift.** The question tests something the chapter does not teach, or assumes a method
   from a later class. Check it against `scope_in`, and especially against `scope_out` — that list
   exists because a model writing questions drifts toward the syllabus it half-remembers. Quote
   the `scope_out` line it violates.

2. **More than one defensible answer.** The commonest real defect. Read every distractor as if
   arguing for it. If a second option is arguably correct under a reasonable reading, the question
   is broken even though the loader passed it.

3. **Distractors that teach nothing.** Each wrong option should correspond to a specific
   misconception — a dropped sign, a flipped rule, the base multiplied by the exponent, the
   number halved instead of rooted. Random wrong numbers make the error diagnosis meaningless,
   which is the whole product.

4. **Answer actually wrong.** Recompute it. Do the arithmetic yourself; do not assume.

5. **Step marks that do not describe real steps.** They sum correctly or the loader would have
   refused, but "Step 1: solve the problem / Step 2: write the answer" grades nothing. Steps must
   name what earns each mark.

6. **Near-duplicates across concepts.** The loader only catches identical text within one file.
   Two questions differing by one number, in different concepts, waste a grid cell each.

7. **Reading level.** Written for the class on the chapter's `subject.class`, not for an adult.

8. **Reversal words unmarked.** A question turning on NOT, least, cannot or false must carry
   `"rev": true`, because reading-discipline errors are tracked separately from concept gaps.

## Useful queries

The local test database is reachable without touching production:

```bash
PGPASSWORD=postgres "/c/Program Files/PostgreSQL/17/bin/psql.exe" -U postgres -h localhost -d examprep_test -c "<sql>"
```

Grid coverage for a chapter, options-per-question sanity, and cross-concept near-duplicates are
all easier in SQL than by reading JSON. For anything in production, read only — never write.

## Reporting

Rank findings by severity: a wrong answer or a second correct option outranks a weak distractor,
which outranks a style point. For each one give the concept code, the question text, what is wrong
and the smallest change that fixes it. If a whole concept is sound, say so in one line rather than
padding.

State how many questions you actually read. If you sampled, say what the sample was — there is no
`review_tier` column or draft/review gate in this codebase (removed 2026-09-17, CLAUDE.md
invariant 4; every question is Approved on creation), so sampling honesty rests on you, not on a
stored tier. As a guide, objective/deterministic types (`mcq`, `fill_blank`, `assertion_reason`,
`multi_statement`) can reasonably be sampled at about 10%; subjective, step-marked types
(`short_answer`, `long_answer`) — or anything with a diagram, map or Telugu item — should be read
in full.

**Never edit, delete or retire a question.** Report and let the reviewer decide. Nothing in this
project is ever hard-deleted.
